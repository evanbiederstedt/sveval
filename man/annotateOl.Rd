\usage{
annotateOl(call.gr, truth.gr, max.ins.gap = 1, min.del.rol = 0.1,
  ins.seq.comp = FALSE, nb.cores = 1, quiet = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{call.gr}{call set}

\item{truth.gr}{truth set}

\item{max.ins.gap}{maximum distance for insertions to be clustered.}

\item{min.del.rol}{minimum reciprocal overlap for deletions (and inversions). Default is 0.1}

\item{ins.seq.comp}{compare sequence instead of insertion sizes. Default is FALSE.}

\item{nb.cores}{number of processors to use. Default is 1.}

\item{quiet}{if TRUE quiet mode with no messages.}
}
\value{
a list with both inputs annotated with the overlap coverage (column 'cov').
